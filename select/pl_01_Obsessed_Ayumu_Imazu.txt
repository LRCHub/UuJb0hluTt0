"You got to let go"
Maybe it's a little too late
'Cause I already put my all
to thetable
Everything about me
from the get go
There goes another love song
Hate that it's becoming
my usual
Taking things slow
I just can't control
Baby I'm incapable of it
Then one day (You show up)
You show up like heaven
sent you here
So I say (Hello)
how you doin' nice to meet you
All my friends (No no) are
telling me
she might be bad news
Now I can't go back
Yeah you know
I'm caught up in you
I get obsessed so easily
Like honestly wtf is wrong
with me
I go two nights out with a girl
And I think I'm in love
Why do I fall so easily
Or is it that she's so perfect
for me
I can't keep on meeting
the love of my life like this
But I guess I'm obsessed
with you
Think I'm doing better
Took a little
but I got my head on (straight)
Finally takin a good care
of me myself and
I don't wanna wait no more
Trying everything
I can like meditating
Keeping myself busy down
to every second
So I don't have time
to fantasize
What could've been like
you and I
But then again (You show up)
You show up like heaven
sent you here
So I say (Hello)
how you doin' nice to meet you
Is all the blame on me
'cause you can't deny
your natural beauty
Now I can't go back
Yeah you know I'm caught up
in you
I get obsessed so easily
Like honestly wtf is wrong
with me
I go two nights out with a girl
And I think I'm in love
Why do I fall so easily
Or is it that she's so perfect
for me
I can't keep on meeting
the love of my life like this
But I guess I'm obsessed
with you
I get obsessed so easily
Like honestly wtf is wrong
with me
I go two nights out with a girl
And I think I'm in love
And Why do I fall so easily
Or is it that she's so perfect
for me
I can't keep on meeting
the love of my life like this
But I guess I'm obsessed
with you
