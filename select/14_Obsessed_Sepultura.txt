I can't stop this fear that's killing, no denying
Hope is dying, living in Hell!
Fear that's killing, no denying
Hope is dying, living in Hell!

Want that, need that, I must have that
Hunger endless, restless spirit

Once you taste the pain of sorrow
No tomorrow, doom upon us, living in Hell!
Once you live it, no forgiveness
Rotting sickness, living in Hell!

Sleepless nights, inviting terror
Impending doom of death and horror

First it starts in the brain
Heavy thoughts that haunt me everyday
A mental trip of helplessness
I can't help but believe I was born obsessed

Obsessed, obsessed!
Obsessed, obsessed!

Fear that's killing, no denying
Hope is dying, living in Hell!
Fear that's killing, no denying
Hope is dying, living in Hell!

There's no future but an end
Hopeless pounding is always deep inside my head
Unwilling to change, it's just insane
Lost in dark, I fall paralyzed

Obsessed, obsessed!
Obsessed, obsessed!

It sneaks its way to haunt reality
All seems hopeless over valued ideas
Unwilling to change
Further into the eternal darkness
